# leptos-todo

The ever-popular to-do list app (can you believe this is the first one I've
written?) built in Rust using Leptos (a WASM frontend framework). I want to
play around with Leptos some more in the future, so I built this to get a
better handle on the general workflow of the framework, especially DOM
manipulation and state management.
